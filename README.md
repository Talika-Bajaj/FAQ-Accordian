# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 16th Frontend Mentor Coding Challenge.

This is my first JavaScript coding challenge from Frontend Mentor, which helped me practice my DOM manipulation skills and accessing array elements using a for loop. The challenge also maintained its focus on CSS styles, which is helping me improve my CSS styling abilities. 

**Had fun building!** ðŸš€
